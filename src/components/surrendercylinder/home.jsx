              <p class="card-text">IndianOil has played a major role in Indiaâ€™s transition to cleaner fuels from the time it started marketing Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) in 1965. Brand Indane was conceived in 1964 to bring modern cooking to Indian kitchens and the first Indane LPG connection was released on 22nd October 1965 at Kolkata.From a humble beginning of a consumer base of around 2,000 in 1965, the brand has grown into a super brand that rules nearly 16 crore kitchens.
              As a matter of fact, every second cooking gas connection in India is an Indane.Indane has now become one of the largest packed-LPG brands in the world with IndianOil as the second largest marketer of LPG globally. Indane is a Consumer Superbrand as conferred by the Superbrands Council of India. It is a brand synonymous with safety, reliability, and convenience.Today, Indane LPG is sold and delivered in six different pack sizes. 
              The 5kg and 14.2 kg cylinders are largely meant for domestic use and comprise almost half of all gas distributed while the 19kg, 47.5 kg and 425 kg Jumbo cylinders are marketed for industrial and commercial consumption.
